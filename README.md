Plant Pals served as my capstone project for the Google Project Management course, where I took on the role of project manager, responsible for updating documentation to ensure a successful launch. The project scenario was as follows:

Office Green is a commercial landscaping company specializing in plant decor for offices and businesses, planned to introduce a new service called Plant Pals. The Director of Product at Office Green envisioned offering high-volume clients small, low-maintenance plants, such as cacti and ferns, for their desks. My role as project manager was to oversee and manage the rollout of this new service.

During the project, I achieved the following:

• Analyzed project documents and supporting materials to identify requirements, assess stakeholders, and address challenges.

• Developed a project charter to align the scope and goals among stakeholders.

• Defined project goals using the SMART criteria and effectively negotiated priorities with stakeholders.

• Created a detailed project plan by analyzing documentation, conducting research, and identifying key tasks and milestones for prioritization.

• Applied communication skills to accurately estimate project task durations.

• Established quality management standards and ensured the project met these standards through evaluation.

• Acquired strategies to lead productive retrospectives by fostering engagement, accountability, and a positive environment.
